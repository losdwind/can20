## Overview

ChainAINexus (CAN) is a revolutionary, modular, and extensible Web3-based platform designed to empower users to effortlessly build complex workflows through a plug-in architecture. It acts as an **Intent-Centric** hub, allowing users to express their needs and have the platform intelligently assemble the necessary tools to fulfill them.

Instead of developing monolithic applications, developers can focus on creating single-functionality plugins, significantly lowering the barrier to entry and fostering a vibrant ecosystem. Users, even without coding experience, can then leverage the intuitive **Plugin Canvas** to visually arrange and combine these plugins, creating custom solutions tailored to their specific requirements.

The modularity of CAN not only accelerates development but also unlocks unprecedented flexibility. Plugins can freely interact and be combined in countless ways, allowing the platform to adapt to a vast spectrum of use cases. As the plugin ecosystem grows, so does the potential for innovation, fueled by the exponentially increasing possibilities of plugin combinations. Furthermore, CAN leverages these user-created workflows to train its AI models, progressively enhancing its automation capabilities and eventually enabling the system to intelligently suggest and even automatically generate plugin combinations based on user intent.

## System Architecture

The architecture is divided into three main layers:

**1. User Layer:**

*   **User Interaction:**  Google Chrome Extension, Dapp, Web Interface, Natural Language Interface
*   **Identity Management:** User Identity, Single-Sign Wallet, Multi-Sign Wallet, DID

**2. Application Layer:**

*   **AI Services:** Intention Recognition, Sentiment Analysis, Natural Language Generation
*   **Transaction Tools:** Smart Contract Audit, Content Recommendation, Wallet Tracking, Asset Issuance
*   **Data Processing:** On-Chain Data Analysis, Off-Chain Data Analysis, Prediction Analysis, Multimodal Data Processing

**3. CAN Core:**

*   **Plugin Canvas:** Modular Combination, Logic Control, Data Flow Management, Permission Management, Security Check
*   **Plugin Store:** Upload & Review, Community Ecosystem, Search & Recommendation, Payment Management, Rating System
*   **Plugin Library:** Plugin Management, Storage & Distribution, Developer Support, Plugin Orchestration Library
*   **Contract Library:** Governance Contract, Staking Contract, Revenue Sharing Contract, CAN PROTOCOL, Algorithm Library (NLP, Diffusion Models, TGAN, TTS)

    *   Comprehensive support for on-chain and off-chain data analysis, smart contract tools, asset management, and predictive analytics.
    *   The modular architecture bridges the gap between Web3 projects and cutting-edge AI technologies, fostering the development of next-generation decentralized applications.

## Technology Stack

CAN utilizes a robust and versatile technology stack:

*   **Smart Contract Development:** Solidity
*   **Artificial Intelligence:** Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js / Express.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL
*   **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js / ethers.js
*   **Containerization:** Docker

## Quick start
> Before installing CAN, make sure your machine meets the following minimum system requirements:
> 
>- CPU >= 2 Core
>- RAM >= 4 GiB

</br>

The easiest way to start the CAN server is through [docker compose](docker/docker-compose.yaml). Before running CAN with the following commands, make sure that [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are installed on your machine:

```bash
cd can20
cd docker
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

After running, you can access the CAN dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost/install](http://localhost/install) and start the initialization process.
